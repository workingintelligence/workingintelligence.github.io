<h6> Working Intelligence is a class at the CIID IDP taught by Simone Rebaudengo, Joshua Noble, and Bjorn Karmann.
We asked 23 students to explore the nature of artificial intelligence in the workplace in the near future,
to explore beyond the dystopian or utopian and instead explore the likely and the mundane from a both playful and critical perspective.</h6>
</br>
<p>
Nearly every day a new investigation or prediction emerges discussing how artificial intelligence and robots will change the way we live and work.  A lot of these visions portray a quite dramatic future where potentially most jobs will vanish, design included, leaving people with little to nothing to do and living from universal basic income or in a dystopic permanent unemployment.
.</p>
<p>While it is true that some jobs will disappear and become purely automated, many jobs will and are shifting in nature and new jobs are born often from not only from the opportunities of new technologies but also from its fallacies and limits, like click farms and mechanical turk.  Rather than thinking of the job that will be lost, we will imagine the new jobs and the tools that will emerge when machine intelligence will actually be an everyday working thing.</p>

<h2>What is the future of work in the age of intelligence and autonomy?
What jobs will be replaced and what will change in nature?
What are the new jobs that will emerge and what will the tools and objects that facilitate this work be?</h2>

<p>
We asked the students to first look back in history to understand how jobs changed with the advent of technologies of the time to then project themselves in the near future.
Thinking about the opportunities and the limits of automation and intelligence in specific working enviornment, when things will work and when things won't.
Rather than looking at a fully automated or a fully manual future, they explored new interaction models and roles that might emerge between people and machines, people and people and machines with other machines

The results is a series of artifacts and stories that paint a different picture of working intelligneces. </p>
