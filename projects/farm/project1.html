        <p class="w">Machu Picchu which was built around the 15th century is one of the first documented urban farms. Machu Picchu was an Incan city built into the Peruvian mountains, using a form of stepped architecture the Incan’s were able to integrate farms directly into their city. This terraced land allowed the Incan’s to incorporate efficient forms of irrigation as well as optimize sun exposure for their crops.</p>

        <h3 class="w c">The Invention of Future's contracts </h2>
        <img src="assets/farm/Futures-Contract.jpg">
        <p class="w">Future contracts were developed in the 17th century which allowed farmers to secure a selling price of their crops and make this estimation at the beginning of their crop cycle. These contracts helped to mitigate risk and plan their year according to these early calculations. However, this strategy strips away a farmers chance of benefitting from higher price valuations because the contracts fix the price of their yield. In addition, farmers are require to pay fees to brokers and advisors in order to obtain these contracts adding additional overhead costs.</p>

        <img src="assets/farm/vertical.jpeg">
        <p class="w">Over the last decade vertical farming has undergone huge technological advancements and its viability as a agriculture production method has been rapidly increasing. These farms require less space and are highly efficient; furthermore, most of the farming process is automated in these devices. Because of the decrease in space requirements vertical farming also carries the affordance of fitting into urban spaces, warehouses, rooftops, even peoples homes. </p>
