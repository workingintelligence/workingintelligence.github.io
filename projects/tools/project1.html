    <h2 class="c">Lex is designed to explore the question of decision automation in sports and whether a machine learned referee is actually more objective than a human referee. In the pickup domain, Lex explores how behaviors of players would change in the presence of a machine learned referee and what the limitations of this technology are. In exploring these questions Lex provides a critical view of the future of machine intervention in sports and insights into how we can better design this collaboration for the future. </h2>
