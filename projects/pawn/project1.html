      <h1 id='title'>Exchange Point - machine haggling and currency exchange <h1>
      <h2 class="c">Exchange Point is multi-currency exchange machine with a quirk - people can haggle with it. Whether people want to trade in health data to earn some Bitcoins or simply want to get rid of an old coffee mug, Exchange Point allows people to sell both personal data and physical items in a convenient way. Data and items can be converted to cash, likes, followers, Bitcoin, ad blocks, and much more.
      Borrowing the metaphor of an ATM and a slot machine, Exchange Point treads the line between providing a legitimate way of extracting money and being an ethically-questionable chance machine.</h2>

    <h2 class="c">The prototype invites people to think about questions such as:
What will be recognised as currency in the future? Who gets to determine the value of a certain currency and how would it be determined? How does it feel to negotiate with a machine? Can a machine really be objective? </h2>
